RPi - Control scripts -- python 3

Various scripts on my RPi controling various things ::

fan_control.py   -- script for controling a fan connected to the relay board 
                 -- temperature measured with W1termal sensor 
               
light_control.py -- script for controling external light connected to the relay board
                 -- LDR and PIR used 
                 -- two relays used one to indicate dusk/dawn so light and second active with motion 
                 -- both interconnected to intruder alarm which controls external (and some internal) lights
                 
sunrise_check.py -- script for checking sunrise and sunset times
                 -- could be use as replacement of the LDR for light control purpose :)
